Mars Met is a web app based on Django coded for Nasa's International Space Apps Challenge 2013.

The first version was coded in about 10 hours by the following developers:

- Ander Goiriena
- Mikel Díaz de Arcaya
- Diego Gil
- Iñigo Hernáez

We would also like to thank Borja Pérez for his invaluable help.

Some other necessary resources not included in this repo:

- Django (pip install django)
- SQL Alchemy (pip install SQLAlchemy)

Additional remarks:

- A PostgreSQL database called "mars_met" must be created. If another name is used, some files may have to be edited.

- The data parser code and the setting.py file of the Django server must be edited to include actual database user and passwords.

Enjoy it!
